# Covid19-API
Hosted on http://159.65.152.207/api/covid19
Built a covid 19 API to track cases, deaths and recoveries for Indian states and most affected countries in the world.
Implemented web crawlers to scrape data every 12 hours from government and educational sites and store that data in a mongoDB instance.
Implemented multiple endpoints for different types of data.
